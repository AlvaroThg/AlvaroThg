### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, pleasure to met y'all :D
Studying in the Bolivian Catholic University. I'm a 17 years old guy that loves to play the guitar and, like my friends, to play videogames. I would really love to travel around the world, I really want to visit Norway and Japan so I would love to go there and know their customs.  

 Sur jeg :D
- I would like to work in an international company like **Microsoft** or **Tesla**
- I'm currently studying **System Engineering**
- I always want to help people.
- I always wanted to be famous :(
- My email alvarobaldiviezo8@gmail.com 
- My name is Alvaro, but you can call me â€˜â€˜Alvaritoâ€™â€™
- Fun fact: I love to cook and I LOVE, I mean, REALLY LOVE chocolate :D

See ya
